title: No import dynamic expression
---

> `import()` paths cannot be dynamic expressions.

## Why This Error Occurred

Webpack and Turbopack both require that the argument passed to `import()` must be a string constant
so that the import target can be determined at build time.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

1. For each possible `import()` target, create a separate hard-coded case. For instance, instead of
   `import(isBaby ? "grogu" : "yoda")`, you could write `isBaby ? import("grogu) : import("yoda")`.
2. Perform a `fetch` to retrieve the target script and run it with `eval`.
